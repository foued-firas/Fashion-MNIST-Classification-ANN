# Fashion-MNIST ANN Classifier

## Description
This project implements an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** for classifying the **Fashion-MNIST** dataset. The model is built using **TensorFlow/Keras** and consists of three dense layers with **256**, **128**, and **10** neurons, using **ReLU** and **Softmax** activation functions.

The dataset is preprocessed with **StandardScaler**, and the model reaches approximately **85% accuracy** on the validation set after **10 epochs**.

The notebook includes:
- Data exploration
- Data visualization
- Model training
- Performance evaluation
